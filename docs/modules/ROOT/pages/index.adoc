= RuboCop factory_bot

https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md[factory_bot]-specific analysis for your projects, as an extension to
https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop[RuboCop].

RuboCop factory_bot follows the https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/versioning.html[RuboCop versioning guide].
In a nutshell, between major versions new cops are introduced in a special `pending` status.
That means that they won't be run unless explicitly told otherwise.
RuboCop will warn on start that certain cops are neither explicitly enabled and disabled.
On a major version release, all `pending` cops are enabled.

== Project Goals

* Simplify the process of adopting new factory_bot functionality
